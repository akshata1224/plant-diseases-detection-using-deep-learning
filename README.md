# plant_diseases_detection_using_deep_learning

The detection and identification of plant leaf disease using image
processing have been studied by researchers over the past years. The
authors have suggested the use of K-means algorithm for the segmentation
of the image. The algorithm was used to partition the dataset into k
numbers of distinct nonoverlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data
point belongs to only one group so as to differentiate the diseased area on
the leaf, the healthy part and the background.
